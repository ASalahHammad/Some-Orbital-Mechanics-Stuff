# Orbital Mechanics Stuff
This package is based on the book [Curtis, H. D. (2010). Orbital mechanics for engineering students (2nd ed.). Butterworth-Heinemann].
as a part of a course I am having at 4th. year undergrad, under the supervision of dr. Atef Sherif.

A very few problems in the package need to be revised and validated for correctness, but most problems and simulations were validated using solved examples in the book.
